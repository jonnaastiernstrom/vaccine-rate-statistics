# COVID Vaccination 

## Introduction

Hello Everyone!

We've been working on this project for 4 weeks, and is all about gathering all the vaccine data for the region. Our goal was to make sense of all the data and visualize it. The users can be anyone, maybe more towards people working in health sector. 

We had Knowit as a product owner, and they presented the project to us with all the user stories needed to get us going. We worked agile, and everything was set to be done within two sprints.

We got together and designed a prototype of the website to illustrate how it was going to look. This wasn't just a prototype, this was the blueprint of what we imagined our real website to be — a place where a lot of confusing data transforms into easy-to-understand visual graphs. 

Our vision is to present everything in different charts......








This chart is representing the vaccination rate of the whole of Östersund county.

In this chart we display the vaccination statistics over each week of the year.

The chart below is showing the vaccination statistics over age, where the user can input a desired age span to view the
vaccination counts for different doses.

We also wanted to show how the vaccination statistics were distributed by gender in the county. 
We showed how many of the gender Women, was vaccinated and not vaccinated. The same with the gender Male.
